# DYT Community – Official Repository of the Diyarbakır Software Community

Welcome to the official repository of the Diyarbakır Software Community (DYT).

This project serves as the open-source home for all community-led technical events, content, and contribution records.

Our mission is to cultivate a collaborative learning environment and promote sustainable, open-source participation across all levels of experience.

## 📁 Repository Structure

All event content is organized under the `events/` directory.

Each subfolder represents a distinct **event series** (e.g., `git-github-opensource`, `linux`, `devops`, etc.).

Each event series defines its own structure, contribution rules, and content within its internal `README.md` file.

To participate, contribute, or learn more about a specific event, please refer directly to its corresponding folder.

## 🌱 Vision

DYT is more than just a tech meetup — it’s a long-term, community-driven learning initiative.

We aim to provide real-world GitHub contribution experience, build local developer capacity, and archive collective progress in an open, transparent way.

Let’s grow stronger, together.
